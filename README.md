#  OceanEye

A marine safety system to help protect fishermen at sea. This is our DBMS course group project.

## The Problem We're Trying to Solve

Fishermen often don't get weather warnings in time, can't call for help during emergencies, and sometimes accidentally enter restricted zones. We wanted to build something that could actually help with these problems.

## What OceanEye Does

It tracks fishing boats in real-time and sends alerts when there's danger - like bad weather, emergencies, or entering restricted areas. The coast guard can also monitor everything and respond quickly when needed.

## Our Team & Who Did What

This is a **3-person group project**:

**My Part (S M Hasibuer Rahman):**
-  Complete backend development (Laravel)
-  Database design and setup
-  Login and registration system (both backend + frontend pages)
-  Testing the system
-  Building APIs for features

**Teammates:**
- [Fardin Mustafi] - Frontend design and development
- [Tanjim Tisha] - Frontend design and development

So basically, I handle everything on the backend side, and they make it look good on the frontend!

## What's Done So Far

 Backend structure with Laravel  
 Database tables and relationships  
 Login page (I designed and coded it)  
 Registration page (I designed and coded it)  
 User authentication working  
 Different user roles (fishermen, coast guard, admin)  

## What We're Still Building

 GPS tracking system  
 Weather warnings  
 Emergency SOS button  
 Dashboard for coast guard  
 Zone monitoring  

## Tech We're Using

**Backend (My work):**
- Laravel - PHP framework
- MySQL - Database
- API development

**Frontend (Team's work):**
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Responsive design
## What I'm Learning

This is my first real backend project, and I'm learning:
- How to structure a Laravel application
- Database design and relationships
- Building secure authentication
- Creating APIs
- Working as a team on a bigger project

Started coding in 3rd January 2026 , so still learning but making progress!
